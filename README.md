# Random_Forest

A **Random Forest** is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple **Decision Trees** to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.  
This project demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and visualize a Random Forest model using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Overview

Random Forest works by creating a large number of decision trees and combining their outputs through **majority voting** (for classification) or **averaging** (for regression).  
It is one of the most powerful and widely used algorithms for both classification and regression problems.
